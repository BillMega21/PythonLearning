This is used as a Coding tips / Coding cheat sheet, consists of those small little tricks/tips that we learn throughout the tutoring

Steps to tackle (probably) any coding exercise
    1. Pseudo code / Task breakdown
    2. Satisfy the requirements
    3. Optimise

------------------------------------------------------

Session 9th Dec
    - Try not to use MAGIC number - declare as constant (full CAP) instead
    

Session 3th Dec:
    - try & except -> catch error and prevent the termination of the program
    - boolean algebra (conditionals grouping)
        . and
        . or
        . not
    - consider the FLAG (boolean) for simple conditional statement (ask again While loop for e.g.)

Session 3 on string/if-else practice:
    - Pseudo block diagram      --> ideation before coding
    - Indexing with len()-1
    - Separate if statement --> if it clearer
    - Using "flag" for nested if-else
