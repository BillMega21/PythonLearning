# PythonLearning

This repo was created during my Python tutoring journey.

First of all, I want to thank all the contributors to the Python community! It would be super hard if there were no helpful resources on the Internet. Here are the two main references I based on.

General on-the-way resources: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/

In-depth resources: https://realpython.com/
