Exercise 1:

- Get a input string from the user --> let use input "python coding" for now

- Check if the string length is greater than 10, first letter is "p", and last letter is "n" 

	- Get a second input string from the user --> let use input "if else" for now

	- Check if this string lenght is shorter than the first input length
		- Combine to two string together (with a space in between) and print it out
	* if not
		- print "condition 2 is not met"
* if not
	- print "condition 1 is not met"

Exercise 2: Temperature conversion functiont that:

- Get the operation input from user to see if they want to convert between Celcius to Fahrenheit or vice versa
- Get the conversion number
- Check (Validate) the input - it is a number?
- Apply conversion formula c/5 = (f-32)/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
- return (or print) the converted value

	Example case 1
		* user type in "CF" - which the code understand to convert from C to F
		* user type in 60
		* code return "60Â°C is 140 in Fahrenheit"
		
	Example case 2		
		* user type in "CF" - which the code understand to from F to C
		* user type in abc
		* code return "invalid input, the program ended" - or something similar saying invalid input
